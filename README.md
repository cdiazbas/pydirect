# pydirect
Python wrapper to the DIRECT global optimization algorithm (forked from http://code.google.com/p/pydirect/source/browse)
DIRECT is a method to solve global bound constraint optimization problems and was originally developed by D. R. Jones, C. D. Perttunen and B. E. Stuckmann.
pydirect is a python wrapper around DIRECT. It enables using DIRECT from the comfort of the great Python scripting language.
The pydirect package uses the fortan implementation of DIRECT written by Joerg.M.Gablonsky, DIRECT Version 2.0.4. More information on the DIRECT algorithm can be found in Gablonsky's thesis (http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/3920/1/etd.pdf).
